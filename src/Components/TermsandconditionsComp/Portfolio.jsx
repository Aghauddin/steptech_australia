      2xl:text-2xl text-gray-700 mb-8">(a) Description. Step Tech Australia LLC Service is an online service where 
      individuals or entities that have signed up with Step Tech Australia LLC as clients (each, a “Client”) can post 
      specific assignments and project descriptions, including illustrative samples or other media (each, a “Creative
      Brief”), revise those Creative Briefs (each, a “Revision Brief”) and obtain responses (each, a “Response”) to 
      those Creative or Revision Briefs from design experts retained by Step Tech Australia LLC(“Members”). Step Tech 
      Australia LLC will provide you, as the Client, the Service according to the Package you have chosen as detailed 
      in section 1(e) below. Your Responses will be created iteratively through a drafting cycle of Creative Briefs,
      Revision Briefs and Responses, ultimately resulting in a final Response conforming to your various Creative and
      Revision Briefs.<br/><br/>(b) Creative Brief and Responses. You are solely responsible for preparing and posting detailed descriptions of 
      each of your Creative Briefs to the Web Site, including providing samples illustrating your Creative Brief and 
      any relevant deadlines. For each Response to a Creative Brief that you want to receive, a term sheet (a “Term 
      Sheet”) will be generated that will contain, and be subject to, the terms and conditions you have established 
      for the Creative or Revision Brief. Step Tech Australia LLC is under no obligation to review a Creative or Revision
      Brief or Term Sheet for any purpose, including accuracy, completeness of information, quality or clarity. Step 
      Tech Australia LLC may decide, in its sole discretion, to deny a Creative or Revision Brief or a Term Sheet.
      <br/><br/>(c) Reviewing Responses. When Step Tech Australia LLC provides you with a Response, you are responsible for 
      reviewing the Response. If you fail to promptly inform Web Design Lane that the Response is not reasonably 
      responsive to the related Term Sheet or Creative Brief, you will be deemed to have accepted the Response. 
      If you notify Step Tech Australia LLC that you think a Response is not reasonably responsive to the related Creative
      Brief, you shall then submit to the Web Site a Revision Brief containing information regarding amendments or 
      modification to be made to the initial Response. After you provide Step Tech Australia LLC with a Revision Brief, 
      Step Tech Australia LLC will provide you with a subsequent Response that conforms to the additional criteria you 
      requested. Step Tech Australia LLC is not responsible for the content of Responses developed to the extent that 
      such Responses are prepared to conform to your Creative or Revision Briefs.<br/><br/>(d) Revision Cycles. 
      Revision cycles generally consist of unlimited additional compositions that incorporate changes you request in a
      Revision Brief. The purpose of the revision process is to create Responses that move your project forward in the
      specific direction you have determined. You may request significant changes in the first and second cycles, and 
      the Responses generated might be quite different in nature from the original composition you selected. By the 
      third revision request, your requests shall be modifications of the current composition only. Revision requests
      that depart from the then-current composition will be honored and completed in a timely manner, however; Step 
      Tech Australia LLC reserves the right to charge the client for each such Revision. No revision work, which requires
      payment, will be started without your authorization.<br/><br/>(e) Packages. You may select from the following 
      Service Packages: Web Design Packages | Ecommerce Website Packages | Web Portal Packages | Web Maintenance 
      Packages | Digital Marketing Packages | Branding Packages | Animated Video Packages.<br/><br/>(f) Client Accounts.
      When you register for the Service, you must pay for the Service via credit card, or other payment method 
      authorized by Step Tech Australia LLC. You will be charged for the Package you have selected along with and 
      additional products and/or services you select as add-ons. If you pay by credit card, you will be required to 
      provide a valid credit card number and credit card billing address when registering as a Client. You will receive 
      receipts for all your transactions with Step Tech Australia LLC. We hold the right to change the fee policy for 
      Clients and impose additional fees on Clients at any time; however, such additional fees will not apply to projects
      submitted before Step Tech Australia LLC decides to implement any such changes in fees.
